<!--         Using multiple levels of cache allows a small fast cache to keep pace with the
CPU, while slower larger caches can be used to reduce the miss penalty since
the next level cache can be used to capture many accesses that would go to
main memory.
The local miss rate is large for higher level caches because the first level
cache benefits the most from data locality.  Thus a global miss rate that
indicates what fraction of the memory access that leave the CPU go all the way
to memory is a more useful measure. -->

          <h2>Cache properties </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Modern processors have from 1 to 4 levels of caches
            <ul>
              <li>Inclusive caches duplicates the data from higher level cache in lower levels</li>
              <li>Exclusive caches contains data only in one level of cache</li>
              <li>Most caches are <b>inclusive</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Data transfer unit between registers and L1 cache is usually in between 1-16 bytes</li>
            <li><b>Cache line</b> is the smallest unit of memory that can be transferred to and form main memory
            (typically 32, 64 bytes, sometimes 128 bytes and more)</li>
            <li>Line is also unit of storage allocation in cache</li>

        <section>
          <h2>Associativity</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Cache associativity</b> is the number of unique places in a cache where any given memory item can reside.</li>
            <li>In an n way associative cache, any cache line from memory can map to any of the n locations in a set.</li>
            <li>1 way set associative cache is called direct mapped.</li>
            <li>A fully associative cache is one in which a cache line can be placed anywhere in cache.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Direct mapped means only one location. But very, very fast.
          Higher associativity is better, but costly in terms of gates and complexity (power and performance).</p>

          <h2>Nonblocking Caches</h2>
          Pipelined computers that allow out-of-order execution can continue fetching instructions from the instruction
          cache while waiting on a data cache miss. A nonblocking cache design allows the data cache to continue to
          supply cache hits during a miss, called <b>hit under miss</b>, or <b>hit under multiple miss</b> if multiple
          misses can be overlapped.  Hit under miss significantly increases the complexity of the cache controller,
          with the complexity increasing as the number of outstanding misses allowed increases. Out-of-order processors
          with hit under miss are generally capable of hiding the  miss penalty of an L1 data cache miss that hits
          in the L2 cache, but are not capable of hiding a significant portion of the L2 miss penalty.

<!--         <section>
At least 3 major approaches:
Make cores as fast/slow as main memory (SiCortex, Tensilica)
Add faster/closer memory pipes (Opteron, Nehalem)
Streaming compute engines (NVIDIA,AMD), vectorized memory pipelines (Convey).

With multiple cores, more than one level can keep MESI states.

Hardware Prefetching
When you see linear scaling graphs, be (somewhat) suspicious.
Linear scalability is easy(ier) when per-core performance is low!
The faster a single core computes, the more vulnerable it is to other bottlenecks.
So producing a linear graph, does not make your program efficient.

Cache Blocking for Multicore
Generally, block for the largest non-shared cache.
L2 on Nehalem.
Depending on the speed difference and amount of work per iteration, L1 may be better.
Never block for the shared cache size.

When a memory location is accessed, the whole cache line
containing the address is copied from memory to the cache
a cache replacement policy defines how old data in the
cache is replaced with new data
tries to keep frequently used data in the cache –
Least Recently Used algorithm

A cache mapping defines where memory locations will be
placed in cache
in which cache line a memory addresses will be placed
we can think of the memory as being divided into blocks of
the size of a cache line
the cache mapping is a simple hash function from
addresses to cache sets
Cache is much smaller than main memory
more than one of the memory blocks can be mapped to the
same cache line
Each cache line is identified by a tag
determines which memory addresses the cache line holds
based on the tag and the valid bit, we can find out if a
particular address is in the cache (hit) or not (miss)

DIRECT MAPPED CACHES
A memory location can be placed in exactly one cache line
Easy to find out if a memory address is in cache or not
there is only one possible location in the cache where a
memory address can be
need only to check the tag and the valid bit in that line
if the tag in the cache matches the address, we have a hit
if the tag does not match the address, we have a miss

FULLY ASSOCIATIVE CACHE
A fully associative cache consists of a single set
a memory block can be placed in any cache line
There is no information about where a memory block will be
placed in the cache
have to search through the whole cache to find the
location containing the tag we are looking for
Implemented by associative memory
can search through all cache lines simultaneously for a
matching tag
Fully associative caches are small and expensive
mainly used for translation lookaside buffers (TLB’s) and
similar

SET ASSOCIATIVE CACHE
A set contains more than one line
A memory block can be placed in any of the lines in the set
Similar to a number of small fully associative caches
Which set a memory block is located in is computed from the
address
2-, 4-, 8- and 16-way set associative caches are often used in
modern processors
